# Personalized Wheel of Life in C – Version 0.6

This project creates a personalized **Wheel of Life**, designed to help users evaluate and visualize different areas of their life. Initially developed as a console-based program, it now includes a **graphical user interface (GUI)** built with **Qt**.

I created it because I couldn’t find one that fully satisfied my needs.

## Features

* **Customization** of the wheel categories (e.g., work, relationships, health, fun, etc.).
* **Graphical visualization** of the selected values as a wheel diagram.
* **Generation of PNG images** using the **Cairo** graphics library.
* **New Qt interface** for easier interaction without using the terminal.

## Technologies Used

* Language: **C**
* GUI Framework: **Qt**
* Graphics Library: **Cairo**
* Output Format: **PNG**

## Version 0.6

The project is still evolving, but the core features are functional. The addition of a GUI makes it more accessible and user-friendly.
