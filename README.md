# Personalized Wheel of Life in C - Version 0.5

This project creates a personalized Wheel of Life, designed to help users evaluate and visualize different areas of their life. The program allows customization of the categories, assigning scores, and generates a graphical visualization in PNG format using the Cairo library.

I created it because I couldn't find one that satisfied my needs.

## Features

- **Customization** of the wheel categories (e.g., work, relationships, health, fun, etc.).
- **Generation of PNG images** with the visualization of the areas of life.

## Technologies Used

- Language: **C**
- Graphics Library: **Cairo**
- Output Format: **PNG**

## Version 0.5

It still requires many improvements, but it is a good start and functional.
